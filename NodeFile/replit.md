# Overview

This is a minimal Node.js starter project with a single entry point that outputs a console message. The project serves as a basic foundation for building Node.js applications, currently containing only the essential package configuration and a simple JavaScript file.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Application Structure

**Entry Point**: Single file architecture with `index.js` as the main entry point.

**Runtime**: Node.js-based application with npm as the package manager.

**Design Pattern**: Currently implements a simple procedural script without any specific architectural pattern. This allows for flexibility in choosing an architecture (MVC, microservices, serverless, etc.) as the project grows.

**Rationale**: The minimal structure provides a clean slate for developers to build upon without being constrained by pre-existing architectural decisions. This approach is ideal for prototyping, learning, or starting new projects where requirements are still being defined.

## Build and Deployment

**Build Process**: No build step required - runs directly via Node.js interpreter.

**Execution**: Simple npm start script that directly executes the main JavaScript file.

**Pros**: 
- Zero configuration overhead
- Fast iteration during development
- No compilation or transpilation delays

**Cons**:
- No TypeScript support out of the box
- No module bundling or optimization
- Limited scalability without additional tooling

# External Dependencies

## Runtime Dependencies

**None currently installed** - The project has zero production dependencies, keeping the application lightweight and minimizing potential security vulnerabilities.

## Development Dependencies

**None currently installed** - No linters, testing frameworks, or development tools are configured.

## Future Considerations

As the project grows, typical dependencies might include:
- Web framework (Express, Fastify, Koa)
- Database drivers or ORMs
- Testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha)
- Linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Environment configuration (dotenv)
